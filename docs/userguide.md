#### Installation
- The package can be found in pypi. To install the package, run the following command in the terminal:
- `pip install scramblery`
#### Usage
- import the package:
- `from scramblery import scramblery`
- The package has 3 functions to use. Use the functions in the following manner:
- `scramblery.scrambleimage("Lena.png",8,8)`
- `scramblery.scrambleface("Lena.png",8)`
-  scramblery.scramblevideo("Lena.png",8,8)
- 
Sometimes there may be some errors related to the size of the image when splitting into squares. Therefore, you may need to edit the number you will reserve. I will fix this issue in future releases.
