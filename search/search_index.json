User can either scramble the whole image or only facial area. This is very useful tool in psychology experiments especially if you are working with faces. Features Scramble whole image with desired degree of scrambling (pixel values or pixel coordinates) Scramble only facial area with desired degree of scrambling (pixel values or pixel coordinates) Scramble only facial area in a video (useful for dynmaic stimuli) with desired degree of scrambling Installation The package can be found in pypi. To install the package, run the following command in the terminal: pip install scramblery Author Main Maintainer: [Enes ALTUN] Usage After installing the package, you can import the package as follows: from scramblery import scramblery Contributon Any kind of contribution is welcome.

Use the functions in the following manner: scramblery.scrambleimage(\"Lena.png\",8,8) scramblery.scrambleface(\"Lena.png\",8) scramblery.scramblevideo(\"Lena.png\",8,8) Sometimes there may be some errors related to the size of the image when splitting into squares. Therefore, you may need to edit the number you will reserve. I will fix this issue in future releases.","title":"User Guide"},{"location":"userguide/#installation","text":"The package can be found in pypi.
